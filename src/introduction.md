# Introduction

When I started working in the field of machine learning engineering many years ago the process of designing machine learning systems seemed like black magic since there weren't a lot of public material on the subject. 

However, last couple of years several good books on machine learning system design has been published, such as [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/) and [Machine Learning Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-design/9781098115777/). This e-book is complementary to these, providing additional design patterns that I have found useful during my career when designing machine learning systems.
